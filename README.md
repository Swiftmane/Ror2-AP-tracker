# Poptracker pack for Risk of Rain 2

A poptracker pack for usage with the Risk of Rain 2 Archipelago Randomizer

## Installation

Download the latest release and place it in the packs folder in poptracker.

If you need it, poptracker can be found [here](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases).

## Explanations

Environments marked in **blue** are ones that you have the item for but cannot reach due to lacking the Progressive Stage/Stage 1 etc. items

Environments marked in **yellow** are ones that logic does not expect you to reach but can be reached regardless.  The relevant environments are:
- Golden Dieback/Treeborn Colony: 
  - Expects Reformed Altar
- Void Locus
  - Expects Bazaar Between Time and Void Fields but can be reached with the Void Portal that spawns rarely after Stage 7
- All goal levels expect access to a full loop including Helminth Hatchery and Sky Meadow
  - Prime Meridian also expects Reformed Altar and one of Golden Dieback and Treeborn Colony but can be reached without them
  - A Moment Whole expects Beads of Fealty but can be reached by finding them in your run
  - Planetarium expects Bazaar Between Time, Void Fields and Void Locus but can be reached by using the frog that spawns at the teleporter after defeating Mithrix
